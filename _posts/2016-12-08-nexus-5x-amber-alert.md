These are the steps to retrieve Amber Alerts and other emergency notifications
from a Nexus 5X phone.  Mine has already upgraded to Android 7.1.1, but the
steps should be similar for previous versions of Android on this device.

1. Open the "Messenger" app, which handles regular text messages.
2. Tap the three dots menu icon in the upper right and select "Settings".
3. Tap "Advanced" which is the last item on the list.
4. Tap "Wireless alerts", third up from the bottom.

The resulting screen is titled "Cell Broadcasts" and lists them in chronological
order with the newest at the top.  The date and time are also visible for each
entry.  (Don't get confused about old messages!)  Tapping an entry brings up the
full text in a small dialog box.

## Why is this important? ##

I couldn't find this information anywhere else online.  Searching on Google
turns up dozens and dozens of postings where people want to turn _off_ the Amber
Alert notifications, which is a little depressing to think about.  And the phone
itself doesn't make it easy to retrieve the messages.  None of those steps were
particularly obvious to me, and I work in the software industry.

When my phone received an Amber Alert earlier this year, it displayed the text
on the lock screen.  In order to do anything with the phone, I had to first
dismiss the alert.  But once it was gone, I could find no trace of it ever
having existed!  This was a little upsetting, because the purpose of Amber
Alerts is to encourage people to be on the lookout.  How am I supposed to watch
for a specific car if I can't go back and compare the license plate in the
message?  Or the other car details?

Strangely, my co-workers with different phones had it much easier.  One fellow's
phone actually listed alerts in a separate app that came with the phone.
Recalling alerts was very easy for him.  I really have to wonder why the Nexus
5X makes it so much more difficult.  I suppose, in a better world, we wouldn't
need things like Amber Alerts.  But that's not the world we live in, and it
does no good to bury these sorts of things.  (Not to mention emergency alerts
like tornado warnings.)

The weather is cold and the night is long, this time of year.  Stay safe out
there!
